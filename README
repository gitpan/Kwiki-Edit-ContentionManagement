Kwiki-Edit-ContentionManagement

This module is designed to manage contention instead of simply displaying a
message that say "Sorry, your screwed".

Currently it simply allows you to say "Save anyway" if the contention
message shows but we could at some point in the future let it guide the user
through merging the documents (3-way merge).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    kwiki -install Kwiki::Edit::ContentionMangement
